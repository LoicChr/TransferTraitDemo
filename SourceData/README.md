# Source data of the figures of 'Linking functional traits to demographic parameters in high-diversity community models' 


The folder contains the raw data of the figures, as well as the complete posterior distribution of the calibrated model.

posterior.csv - posterior distribution of the transfer function parameters. Each column is one of the parameters.

Fig2A.csv - contains the predictive relative abundance ('relAb') of each species ("species") for each unique temperature value ("temp")

Fig2B.csv - contains the observed pseudo R2 values ("obs") associated to each plot ("plot"). Are also indicated the associated temperature value ("temp") and the 95% quantile of the distribution of the pseudo R2 values of the null models.

Fig3A.csv - contains the correlation value between the calibrated demographic rate parameters and each empirical functional traits. The column names indicate which pairs of demographic rates - functional traits the correlation value refers to. Each row represents a sample of the posterior distribution.

Fig3B.csv - contains the correlation value among the calibrated demographic rate parameters. The column names indicate which pairs of demographic rates the correlation value refers to. Each row represents a sample of the posterior distribution.

Fig4.csv - contains the demographic rate parameters values ('Tmin', 'l', 'c') for each species ('species') and the associated functional group ('FG')
